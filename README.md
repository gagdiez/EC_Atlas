# An Extrinsic Connectivity Based Atlas.

We recently presented a technique to parcellate the human cortex based on its extrinsic connectivity (Gallardo et al 2017). Using this tehcnique, we computed a novel atlas of the human cortex. In [the website](https://gagdiez.github.io/EC_atlas/) you can find our atlas and other resources related to it.
